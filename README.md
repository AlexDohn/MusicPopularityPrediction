#### Music streaming services have become super popular amongst people of all ages. It has become a huge part of social media and many other fields in coorelation to usage in movies, business, etc. I wanted to see if we could predict what would be the most popular in the future years. This would be extremely important not just for the younger generation in enjoyment, but could also be used in a multitude of different ways in order to get more customers or anything you can really think of.

#### We collected our data from two Kaggle sets. The first kaggle set was from the Spotify's Worldwide Daily Song Rating dataset, which holds the top 200 streamed songs in 53 different countries. And the second is from the Analysis of Spotify trends dataset. This set holds the top 50 spotify songs up to 2019.

#### I was not able to figure out how to correctly create the recommendation system, but will be continuing the work in the near future with possible additions of newer datasets to make the system more up to date and accurate to the current timeline.

#### Below I have the links to both datasets.
